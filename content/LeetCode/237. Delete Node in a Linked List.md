# 237. Delete Node in a Linked List
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.

删除一个链表中给定的结点（除尾结点外），唯一的参数就是要删除的那个结点。
```cpp
void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
    node->val = node->next->val;
    ListNode *del = node->next;
    node->next = node->next->next;
    delete del;
}
```
