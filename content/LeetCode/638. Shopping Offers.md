# 638. Shopping Offers
In LeetCode Store, there are some kinds of items to sell. Each item has a price.

However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more different kinds of items with a sale price.

You are given the each item's price, a set of special offers, and the number we need to buy for each item. The job is to output the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers.

Each special offer is represented in the form of an array, the last number represents the price you need to pay for this special offer, other numbers represents how many specific items you could get if you buy this offer.

You could use any of special offers as many times as you want.

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,5], [[3,0,5],[1,2,10]], [3,2]
Output: 14
Explanation: 
There are two kinds of items, A and B. Their prices are $2 and $5 respectively. 
In special offer 1, you can pay $5 for 3A and 0B
In special offer 2, you can pay $10 for 1A and 2B. 
You need to buy 3A and 2B, so you may pay $10 for 1A and 2B (special offer #2), and $4 for 2A.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [2,3,4], [[1,1,0,4],[2,2,1,9]], [1,2,1]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
The price of A is $2, and $3 for B, $4 for C. 
You may pay $4 for 1A and 1B, and $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C. 
You need to buy 1A ,2B and 1C, so you may pay $4 for 1A and 1B (special offer #1), and $3 for 1B, $4 for 1C. 
You cannot add more items, though only $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C.
```
Note:
There are at most 6 kinds of items, 100 special offers.
For each item, you need to buy at most 6 of them.
You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price.

购买指定数目的一些商品。给定每种商品的价格，以及一些商品组合购买的优惠券，优惠券可以重复使用，求最少花多少钱，注意商品不能多买。
1.先计算不使用任何优惠券要花多少钱。然后用一个变量tempRs记录当前购买方案的花销。用一个变量res记录当前最小花销
2.然后开始遍历每种优惠券方案，判断当前优惠券能不能使用（如果优惠券的其中一种商品的购买数量大于当前需要购买的商品数量，则该优惠券不能使用）。
3.如果当前优惠券可用，就更新临时结果tempRs，以及余下所需购买的商品数量needs。
4.最后剩下了一些商品无法用优惠券购买，就以单价买下。计算当前购买方案的花销tempRs并与res比较取较小的更新res。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int shoppingOffers(vector<int>& price, vector<vector<int>>& special, vector<int>& needs) {
        int rs = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < needs.size(); ++i) rs += price[i] * needs[i];
        shoppingHelper(price, special, needs, 0, 0, rs);
        return rs;
    }

    void shoppingHelper(vector<int>& price, vector<vector<int>>& special, vector<int>& needs, int tempRs, int spIndex ,int &rs) {
        int i = 0;
        for (i = spIndex; i < special.size(); ++i) {
            int j = 0;
            for (; j < special[0].size() - 1; ++j) {
                needs[j] -= special[i][j];
                //不符合条件
                if (needs[j] < 0) {
                    while (j >= 0) {
                        needs[j] += special[i][j];//恢复
                        --j;
                    }
                    break;
                }
            }
            //符合条件
            if (j == special[0].size() - 1) {
                shoppingHelper(price, special, needs, tempRs + special[i][j], i, rs);
                //恢复
                for (int k = 0; k < special[0].size() - 1; ++k) needs[k] += special[i][k];
            }
        }
        if (i == special.size()) {
            for (int m = 0; m < needs.size(); ++m) {
                tempRs += price[m] * needs[m];
            }
            rs = min(rs,tempRs);
        }
    }
};
```

如果用回溯法会超时。
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int shoppingOffers(vector<int>& price, vector<vector<int>>& special, vector<int>& needs) {
        int rs = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < needs.size(); ++i) rs += price[i] * needs[i];
        shoppingHelper(price, special, needs, 0, 0, rs);
        return rs;
    }

    void dfsHelper(vector<int>& price, vector<vector<int>>& special, vector<int>& needs, int tempRs, int spIndex ,int &rs) {
        if (spIndex == special.size()) {
            for (int i = 0; i < needs.size(); ++i) {
                tempRs += price[i] * needs[i];
            }
            rs = min(rs,tempRs);
        }
        int i = 0;
        for (i = spIndex; i < special.size(); ++i) {
            int j = 0;
            for (; j < special[0].size() - 1; ++j) {
                needs[j] -= special[i][j];
                //不符合条件
                if (needs[j] < 0) {
                    while (j >= 0) {
                        needs[j] += special[i][j];
                        --j;
                    }
                    dfsHelper(price, special, needs, tempRs, i+1, rs);
                    break;
                }
            }
            //符合条件
            if (j == special[0].size() - 1) {
                dfsHelper(price, special, needs, tempRs + special[i][j], i, rs);
                for (int k = 0; k < special[0].size() - 1; ++k) needs[k] += special[i][k];
            }
        }
    }
};
