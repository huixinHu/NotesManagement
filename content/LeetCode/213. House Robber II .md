You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

```
Input: [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
             because they are adjacent houses.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

打家劫舍II。有一些房子，围成一个圈，如果打劫相邻的两间就会触发报警，问打劫最大收获金钱数。和第一版的那道题的不同点在于房子现在是围成圈的。

因为房子首尾相接，所以现在去了第一间就不能取最后一间房子，去了最后一间就不能去第一间。问题转化为求：nums[0, n-2]和 nums[1, n-1] 两种方案打劫所得的较大值。

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int> &nums, int l, int r) {
        vector<int> dp(nums.size(), 0);
        dp[l] = nums[l];
        dp[l+1] = max(nums[l], nums[l+1]);
        for (int i = l+2; i <= r; i++) {
            dp[i] = max(nums[i] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1]);
        }
        return dp[r];
    }

    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int sz = nums.size();
        if (nums.size() <= 1) return sz ? nums[0] : 0;
        return max(rob(nums, 0, sz-2), rob(nums, 1, sz-1));
    }
};
```

代码还能再优化一些，求dp数组的每一项只需要用到它的前两项，可以把空间复杂度降到O(1)
