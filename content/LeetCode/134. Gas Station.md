There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

**Note:**

- If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
- Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
- Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
gas  = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]

Output: -1

Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

加油站问题，一个环形跑道上有几个加油站，每个站可以加一定的油，从一个站开去下一个站会消耗一定量的油，问从哪个站出发，能够开一圈回到起点？汽车一开始是没有油的，顺时针出发。

首先，如果总的加油数小于总的耗油数，显然肯定不能跑完一圈。所以gas的总量要大于等于cost的总量。

现在我们从station 0开始出发，假设油箱油量可以是负数，这趟旅程最困难的部分就是油量持续减少的时候。最困难的时候就是油量最少的时候，所以要找到油量最小值的位置，它的下一个站就是要求的起点。

```cpp
int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
    int gasSum = accumulate(gas.begin(), gas.end(), 0);
    int costSum = accumulate(cost.begin(), cost.end(), 0);
    if (gasSum < costSum) return -1;
    int total = 0, min = 0, loc = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < gas.size(); i++) {
        total += gas[i] - cost[i];
        if (total < min) {
            min = total;
            loc = (i+1) % gas.size();
        }
    }
    return loc;
}
```
